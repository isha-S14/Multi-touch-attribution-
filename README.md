# Multi-touch-attribution

# Project Overview

This project applies behavioral analytics and multi-touch attribution modeling on real e-commerce clickstream data to understand how different user interactions contribute to conversions.

The dataset does not include marketing channels, reflecting real-world tracking limitations. Attribution channels are engineered using behavioral patterns, similar to how analysts work in privacy-restricted environments.

# Business Objectives

Compare attribution models for better budget decisions

# Attribution Models Implemented
